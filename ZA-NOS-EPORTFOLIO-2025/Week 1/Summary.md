In the first week of the lecture, we were introduced to this module and the lecturer who will be teaching us about it. We were told how we would be getting assessed on this module, which included coursework and an exam taking place in May, both being worth 50%.

We learned about many topics during the lecture including:

1. What a network is and some examples of it, with the internet being the biggest one.
2. How the internet completely changed the structure of things like business, communication, education ect.
3. The structure of the internet eg. Tier 1, 2 and Local ISPs and how ISPs interconnect using IXPs for efficient routing of data.
4. Different communication methods like packet switching and circuit switching and how efficient packet switching is for modern networks.
5. Protocols such as TCP, DNS, HTTP and how they ensure communication along different devices/networks
6. Even the impact of if a component was to fail and that even high end systems can be severely affected.

I have also developed my strengths/weaknesses of the lecture:

Strengths:
1. Clear visuals that made some concepts easier to understand
2. Real-world examples such as the netflix traffic and the ISP structure, connecting theory to practical use

However, I felt as if the lectures were too dense in topic and there was an overwhelming amount of content in some of them. This also applies to the other weeks as well.

Also some parts including cumulitive reliability and binomial distribution could've had simpler explanations in my opinion.
